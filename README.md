- Following cameras should work:
A7R5 A7M4 ZV-E1 ZV-1F ZV-1 II ZV1 ZV-E10 FX30 A1 A7C II A7CII A6700 A6600 A6400 A6100 A7R IV III A7 IV III A9 II RX100 VII RX0 II
- Tested on Galaxy Watch 7 and Pixel 8 paired with a Sony ZV1, but it should work with other combinations.

### Usage
- The first time put the camera in pairing mode.
- Open the app, touch 'Scan', then connect to your camera. (This might be buggy, so try a few times)
- To take a picture, keep the shutter button pressed until focus is acquired and the picture (or pictures in the case of bracketing) has been taken.
- You could use this in combination with a crane to do focus or zoom in/out if the crane can't control the camera. (Example: ZHIYUN Crane M3)
